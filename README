Seamless
========

  Seamless is a software DVD player, a program that allows you to
  watch DVD movies on your laptop or desktop computer. Seamless offers
  support for menus, angles and many other popular DVD features, and
  is able to play most commercial DVD movies available. Currently,
  Seamless offers a simple graphical user interface, that can be
  controlled with either the keyboard or a remote control. It includes
  a full-screen mode that is adequate for comfortably watching movies
  using your computer monitor or a external TV set.

  Seamless is available under the terms of the GNU General Public
  License, which means you are free to download it, install it in as
  many computers as you please, and even hand it all of your friends
  and relatives (they'll surely love it!). Also, if you are so
  inclined, you can study Seamless' program source code and modify it
  to better fit your needs and desires. If you want to read the fine
  print, you can take a look at the file named COPYING in this
  directory, which not only contains the exact license conditions but
  will give you a peek into the wonderful world of Free Software.

  Seamless was written by yours truly, Martin A. Soto
  <soto@freedesktop.org>. It is based on the great GStreamer Media
  Framework (http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/).


A Note to Casual Users
----------------------

  If you are just looking for a free movie player, and your personal
  interests don't particularly lie in the computer or multimedia
  realms, Seamless may be still too hard to install and too
  uncomfortable to operate for your tastes. I'm trying to improve this
  situation, but since I'm working on Seamless in my scarce free time,
  I cannot make any hard commitments about when it'll be ready for
  general consumption. Of course, you're still welcome to read on and
  judge for yourself if the current state of Seamless is adequate for
  your needs.


Software and Hardware Requirements
----------------------------------

  Right now, and according to my knowledge, Seamless will only work
  under the GNU/Linux operating system, running on Intel i386
  compatible processors (AMD and Via should be fine, of course). In
  its current state, it won't run on PowerPC (or any other big endian)
  processors, but this may be easy to fix (see the developer's notes
  below).

  Since video decoding happens completely in software, a relatively
  fast processor is necessary (according to my experience, 1.2 GHz or
  faster should do). Having good support for the XVideo extension in
  your video driver is also very helpful to achieve smooth playback.


Compiling from the GNU Arch repository
--------------------------------------

  Seamless is alpha software and still depends on the bleeding edge of
  the GStreamer technology. Unfortunately, compiling it at the moment
  is not the easiest of all tasks. The following compile instructions
  are intended for people with some understanding of the GNU/Linux
  development environment.

  You need to have the following packages installed:

  - Python (http://www.python.org/) version 2.4 or newer. Make sure
    the corresponding C development files (libraries, headers) are
    also installed.

  - GStreamer (http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/) current version from
    CVS. You need to check out and compile at least the gstreamer,
    gst-plugins-base, gst-plugins-ugly and gst-python
    modules. Released versions of these packages most probably won't
    work.

    When compiling the GStreamer plugins, check the configure script
    output for the gst-plugin-* packages, to make sure that at least
    alsa, xvimage, mpeg2dec and a52dec will be compiled. If configure
    reports that a plugin won't be compiled, install the proper
    dependencies.

  - PyGTK (http://www.pygtk.org/) version 2.8 or newer.

  - libdvdread
    (http://www.dtek.chalmers.se/groups/dvd/downloads.shtml). I'm
    using version 0.9.4.

  - Pyrex (http://nz.cosc.canterbury.ac.nz/~greg/python/Pyrex/). I'm
    using version 0.9.3.

  - The GNU autotools: Autoconf
    (http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/), version 2.59 or later,
    Automake (http://www.gnu.org/software/automake) version 1.9, and
    libtool (http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/) version 1.5.6 or
    later.

  Except for the GStreamer related packages, which currently must be
  the development versions and have to be downloaded and compiled
  manually, all other packages should be available from your favorite
  GNU/Linux distribution (I'm using Ubuntu Breezy.)

  If you managed to get the dependencies right, compiling Seamless
  itself is not that hard. Move to the seamless main directory and
  type

    ./autogen.sh
    make

  If everything went OK, you should be ready to run after this step.


Running Seamless
----------------

  To start the program, run the src/seamless.py script in the source
  tree. The default configuration displays video through the XVideo
  XServer extension, and plays audio through the first ALSA supported
  sound card found. This should work out of the box in most systems
  around.

  In case you need to tweak this setup, you can run seamless with the
  --help option to see a description of the available parameters.

  Once playing, usage is pretty simple:

  - Use the arrow keys to move inside menus and the "Return" key to
    confirm.

  - When playing a film "Esc" takes you to the menu ("menu" key in a
    normal remote)

  - PageUp and PageDown jump chapters back and forth.

  - Shift + RightArrow and Shift + LeftArrow jump 10 seconds forward
    and backward, respectively.

  - Clicking anywhere on the main window switches between normal and
    full screen mode.

  - "P" pauses playback. Pressing "P" again restarts it.

  - "F2" switches audio streams.

  - "F3" switches angles.

  - Closing the window terminates the program.
