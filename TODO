Player Operation
----------------

- Implement a pause operation.

- Revise the implementation of the chapter backward operation,
  to make it behave like a typical player, i.e., backward goes to the
  beginning of the current chapter, except when closely following
  another backward.

- Revise the chapter forward operation such that it jumps to the end
  of the current chapter instead of to the beginning of the next
  one. That way the final code gets executed anyway.

- Trap the stop (^Z) signal and stop the clock while the program is
  suspended.

- Implement free changing of subtitles

- Implement backwards and fast playing.

- Implement auto NTSC/PAL mode.

- Implement exact seeking using the jump fields in nav packets.


Robustness
----------

- Implement timeout when pipeline doesn't go to PLAY.

- Add exception and error handling to the pipeline module.


DVD (Mis)Features
-----------------

- Reemplement DVD aspect ratio handling.

- Support angles. (partially complete?)

- Some menu subpictures get displayed too early. Why?

- Implement support for DTS.

- Implement the cell time as still time thing.

- Honor prohibited operations when it makes sense, or ignore them
  smartly.

- Correct improper highlight handling in DVDs with letterboxed +
  widescreen support. (fixed?)

- Handle button nav packets properly with respect to time.


Internals
---------

- Add __richcmp__ to dvdread wrappers as necessary.


Remote
------

- Create a Pyrex wrapper for lirc.

- LIRC component fails miserably when no LIRC kernel modules are
  available.
