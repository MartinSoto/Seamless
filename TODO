- Add __richcmp__ to dvdread wrappers as necessary.

- Implement backwards playing.

- Implement proper VOBU jumping, using the jump fields in nav packets.

  available.

Particular DVDs
---------------

- The Others: Main menu doesn't show the highlight. You can't get out
  of the film.

- A Bug's Life: Initial language selection frame doesn't display the
  first time. Scene selection doesn't work. Seems to be a machine
  problem.

- Lord of the Rings, The Two Towers: No character voices (only
  background sounds and music) when playing with the a52dec
  element. Apparently it cannot handle Dolby Digital EX sound
  properly. This DVD works fine with the external decoder.
