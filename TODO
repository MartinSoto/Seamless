  available.

  widescreen support.


Particular DVDs
---------------

- The Others: Main menu doesn't show the highlight.

- Lola rennt: No highlight in some menus, e.g., Extras.

- Lord of the Rings, The Two Towers: No character voices (only
  background sounds and music) when playing with the a52dec
  element. Apparently it cannot handle Dolby Digital EX sound
  properly. This DVD works fine with the external decoder.
