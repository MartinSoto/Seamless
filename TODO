Bugs
----

- xvimagesink still causes crashes sometimes when setting the window
  id for the first time.

- There's apparently a race condition, that causes the player to hang
  when many flushes happen close to each other.


User Interface
--------------

- (1) Add a menubar and a toolbar for normal operation.

- (1) Autodetect DVD drives when possible, and start playback
  automatically when a disc is inserted.

- (1) Use default audio and video sinks defined in the Gnome multimedia
  systems selector.

- (2) Add a status display (current title/chaper, playing time, etc.)


Player Operation
----------------

- (1) Implement menu operation using the mouse pointer.

- (3) Revise the implementation of the chapter backward operation, to
  make it behave like a typical player, i.e., backward goes to the
  beginning of the current chapter, except when closely following
  another backward.

- (3) Revise the chapter forward operation such that it jumps to the
  end of the current chapter instead of to the beginning of the next
  one. That way the final code gets executed anyway.

- (2) Trap the stop (^Z) signal and stop the clock while the program is
  suspended.

- (2) Implement free changing of subtitles

- (4) Implement backwards and fast playing.

- (4) Implement auto NTSC/PAL mode.

- (4) Implement exact seeking using the jump fields in nav packets.


Robustness
----------

- (1) Implement timeout when pipeline doesn't go to PLAY.

- (1) Add exception and error handling to the pipeline module.


DVD (Mis)Features
-----------------

- (3) Implement highlights when selecting buttons

- (2) Handle button nav packets properly with respect to time.

  - Some menu subpictures get displayed too early.

- (1) Implement the cell time as still time thing.

- (2) Honor prohibited operations when it makes sense, or ignore them
  smartly.

- (4) Implement support for non-seamless angles (AFAIK, I have no DVD
  using them.)

- (4) Implement support for DTS.


Internals
---------

- (5) Add __richcmp__ to dvdread wrappers as necessary.


Remote
------

- (5) Create a Pyrex wrapper for lirc.

- (5) LIRC component fails miserably when no LIRC kernel modules are
  available.
