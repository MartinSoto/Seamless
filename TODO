Player Operation
----------------

- Revise the implementation of the chapter backward operation,
  to make it behave like a typical player, i.e., backward goes to the
  beginning of the current chapter, except when closely following
  another backward.

- Revise the chapter forward operation such that it jumps to the end
  of the current chapter instead of to the beginning of the next
  one. That way the final code gets executed anyway.

- Trap the stop (^Z) signal and stop the clock while the program is
  suspended.

- Implement free changing of subtitles

- Implement backwards and fast playing.

- Implement auto NTSC/PAL mode.

- Implement exact seeking using the jump fields in nav packets.

- Implement a pause operation. (Done 2006-01-02)


Robustness
----------

- Implement timeout when pipeline doesn't go to PLAY.

- Add exception and error handling to the pipeline module.


DVD (Mis)Features
-----------------

- Implement the cell time as still time thing.

- Handle button nav packets properly with respect to time.

- Some menu subpictures get displayed too early. Why?

- Honor prohibited operations when it makes sense, or ignore them
  smartly.

- Implement support for non-seamless angles (AFAIK, I have no DVD
  using them.)

- Implement support for DTS.

- Reemplement DVD aspect ratio handling. (Done 2006-01-01)


Internals
---------

- Add __richcmp__ to dvdread wrappers as necessary.


Remote
------

- Create a Pyrex wrapper for lirc.

- LIRC component fails miserably when no LIRC kernel modules are
  available.
